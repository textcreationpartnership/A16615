         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>RIght Honorable and mo≈øt Chri≈øtian Senat, as at your la≈øt Ses≈øion, there were certayne Arguments directed unto You for the quickening of your godly Zeale to ≈øpeake, not onely boldly, but al≈øo in all humilitie to the Kings mo≈øt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Maie≈øtie, for the Mini≈øters ≈øu≈øpended and deprived for not Sub≈øcribing and Conformyng them≈øelues to ≈øome pre≈øent Con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, and as ye did graciou≈øly accept of the ≈øayd Arguments, and mo≈øt worthily acquite your ≈øelues to the utmo≈øt of your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, touching the matter pleaded for by them: ≈øo now vouch≈øafe (I mo≈øt humblie be≈øeech you) the like favorable acceptance of a ≈øober, mode≈øt, and iu≈øt defence of the ≈øame Arguments again≈øt a late uncharitable, unchri≈øtian, bitter, calumnious, and cavilling an≈øwer, publi≈øhed under the title of <hi>A con≈øideration</hi> of them by <hi>M. Gabril Powel.</hi> I am bold in ≈øteed of the author him≈øelfe of the Arguments, to take the defence of them upon me, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent them to your Honors, becau≈øe <hi>M. Powel</hi> him≈øelfe in his ≈øaid pretended an≈øwer unto them, hath ≈øo often referred the iudgment of the Arguments of his <hi>con≈øideration</hi> of them, and of the whole cau≈øe, to your mo≈øt graue and gracious company. Yea, there is nothing that I am more willing unto, or which I doe more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øtly de≈øire, then that the cau≈øe betwixt <hi>M. Powel</hi> and all tho≈øe for whom he pleadeth on the one parte, and the author of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and me the defendant with all other in who≈øe behalfe we ≈øpeake on the other parte, might be iudiciou≈ø≈øy and equally heard at the barre of your mo≈øt <hi>Chri≈øtian Court.</hi> But the truth is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe
<pb facs="tcp:4866:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> we de≈øire and endeavor this, <hi>hinc illae lacrymae.</hi> Hence is their chiefe hatred of us, their great contention with us, and their bitter writing again≈øt us. Notwith≈øtanding though now we be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iu≈øtly charged as writing from <hi>Cimerian</hi> darknes, for concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our names; yet if publike libertie might be granted to both parts, to ≈øtand before your iudgment ≈øeat, there freely to plead &amp; debate the cau≈øe by the word of God, and that neither the worldly might and pompe of our adver≈øaries, nor our meannes and ba≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes might be re≈øpected, but the truth it ≈øelfe ≈øimplie con≈øidered and regarded, we would al≈øo accoumpt it as a ≈øingular mercy of God, and as a ≈øpeciall favor of you towards us in that behalfe.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, I doe in all humility referr the Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ts, togeather with the defence of them to your graue and iudicious con≈øideration again≈øt your next meeting in Parliament: not doub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting but that the equitie of the cau≈øe, and the innocencie of our ≈øelues will therby be ≈øo apparant unto you, that though before ≈øom perhaps among you, did thinke the one not to be ≈øo iu≈øt, and the other not ≈øo free from all blame, yet when ye ≈øhall agayne a≈ø≈øemble, ye will all with one mouth as one man, both iu≈øtifie the cau≈øe, and al≈øo ≈øpeake more then ever before ye haue don, for favor unto vs, and to our people: betwixt whom the bond before made by the Church, and ≈øealed by the holy Gho≈øt in the effects of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtery, cannot by any Lordly Epi≈øcopall ≈øeverity be iu≈øtly di≈ø≈øolved.</p>
            <p>I doe further likewi≈øe humblie craue your Honorable lawfull favor more ≈øpecially towards me (if at any time I ≈øhall be di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered) again≈øt all tho≈øe that ≈øhall not well brooke the ≈øober and mode≈øt taxing of their corruptions in this defence: e≈øpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidering the ≈øame is not done of any contentious minde; but onely in loue of the truth, to ≈øupport it again≈øt tho≈øe that deprave it: and in regard of our owne good names, to mainteyne our owne in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nocency again≈øt tho≈øe that under the name of brethren, doe mo≈øt unbrotherly di≈øgrace us.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:4866:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Moreover, if any thing in this defence following, or in the Arguments them≈øelues, by the malice of any ≈øhalbe wre≈øted and perverted, thereby al≈øo to wre≈øt and pervert the law to the danger of the ≈øeverall authors of the one or the other (being found out) may it likewi≈øe plea≈øe you, in all lawfull and righteous manner to put forth your ≈øelues for protection of the ≈øayd authors: as chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becau≈øe ≈øuch wre≈øting of words and perverting of iudgment, may procure Gods iudgments again≈øt them≈øelues that ≈øhall ≈øo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and again≈øt the whole land; ≈øo likewi≈øe becau≈øe to ≈øpeake in ≈øuch matters and for ≈øuch per≈øons (what≈øoever the an≈øwerer ≈øaith to the contrary) ≈øhall not only bring much peace &amp; comfort to ≈øuch ≈øpeakers them≈øelues, but ≈øhall al≈øo be beneficiall to the whole land, as is ≈øhewed in the Arguments, nothing infringed or weakened, by all <hi>M.

            <p>Yea let this con≈øideration be a third rea≈øon to moue you the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øo to ≈øpeake, viz. that if one man had the divinity &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in law, as al≈øo all other learning, wit and wi≈ødom of all men, yet could he not ≈øo warily and circum≈øpectly write in all things, but that ≈øome wrangler or other (in≈øtructed and ≈øet a worke by the ≈øerpent, that is more ≈øubtle, not onely then all bea≈øts, but al≈øo then all men now living on the earth) might and would find ≈øome matter or other, wherby to mole≈øt and trouble him.</p>
            <p>I had thought much more to haue enlarged this my preface, but the prolixity of the defence it ≈øelfe much exceeded my fir≈øt purpo≈ø, I will here conclude, both humblie and with all thanks to God &amp; to your ≈øelues acknowledging your mo≈øt religious &amp; gracious endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors at your la≈øt Ses≈øion for the cau≈øe and for the per≈øons pleaded for in the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ts; and mo≈øt heartily &amp; in≈øtantly likewi≈øe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for you &amp; yours as <hi>Nehemiah</hi>

               <hi>A BREEFE NOTE OF SOME OF THE CHIEFE</hi> generall poynts handled in this defence following.</head>
            <p>THat the author of the Arguments is fal≈øly accu≈øed to impute any di≈ø≈øembling or equivocating to the Kings mo≈øt excellent Maje≈øty, but that in all things he hath conceaved and written mo≈øt reverently, Chri≈øtiantly and duetifully of his Maje≈øtie.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That he is as vntruely charged with any vndutifull ≈øpeeches again≈øt the Nobility, or any other that haue obeyed his Maje≈øties procedings</p>
            <p n="3">3 That the Mini≈øters pleaded for are not refractary, ≈øuper≈øtitious, or ≈øchi≈ømaticall: neyther confronters of the Magi≈øtrat, or troublers of the ≈øtate, but that the≈øe and other the like imputations doe rather belong to their accu≈øers</p>
            <p n="4">4 That our Churches of England are in nothing ≈øo glorious ≈øtate as is pretended by <hi>M. Powel,</hi> and other prelaticall per≈øons but rather in divers re≈øpects, and for divers parts <hi>thereof</hi> in lamentable condition.</p>
            <p n="5">5 That the late proceedings of the Prelats again≈øt ≈øuch Mini≈øters for not ≈øub≈øcribing, conforming etc: &amp; that many of the late <hi>Canons</hi> or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tutions are contrary to the word of God, &amp; the lawes of this Realme.</p>
            <p n="6">6 That the oth likewi≈øe <hi>Ex Officio</hi> is repugnant to the lawes of this Realme: yea abrogated by them, &amp; only inforced by forreyne Canons.</p>
            <p n="7">7 That the obedience &amp; loyaltie of the Mini≈øters for con≈øcience of Gods word not conforming them≈øelues, is as good as of the greate≈øt conformitans, yea that their not conforming the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øelues in that re≈øpect, maketh more then conformity for the good &amp; ≈øafetie of his Maje≈øtie.</p>
            <p n="8">8 That the Con≈øiderer of the arguments, in his incon≈øiderat con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them, hath mo≈øt unreverently and undutifully cen≈øured the High Court of Parliament, for their late mo≈øt religious indeavors in behalfe of the Mini≈øters pleaded for in the ≈øayd Arguments.</p>

            <head>A DEFENCE OF THE ARGVMENTES Lately directed to the High Court of Parliament for <hi>the Mini≈øters ≈øilenced ect, again≈øt the an≈øwer unto them by</hi> M. Gabriel Powell.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ll though the late an≈øwer of <hi>M. Powell</hi> to the Arguments in the title mentioned, for moment of matter be not ≈øuch, that either any di≈øgrace of the ≈øayd Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or of the cau≈øe it ≈øelfe, with any wi≈øe and judicious reader, neede to be feared thereby; or that therefore the ≈øaid an≈øwer ≈øhould haue reply thereunto: yet for their ≈øake that are not ≈øo ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious; and that neither the an≈øwerer him≈øelfe, neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other by our ≈øilence may haue any cau≈øe to in≈øult and triumph, as having wonne ≈øome great field, and gotten ≈øome worthy victory, I haue pre≈øumed to take upon me the replying thereunto, in≈øteed of the author him≈øelfe.</p>
            <p>Heerein (notwith≈øtanding the an≈øwerer his ≈øcoffing at our triobular Pamphlets) I will labour as much as I may for brevity, that ≈øo the Chri≈øtian reader may the le≈ø≈øe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hindred from his other waighty affayres. For this cau≈øe I nether will reply to the whole an≈øwer, neither will cau≈øe the ≈øayd an≈øwer to be wholly reprinted, but will onely mo≈øt breifly collect ≈øuch things, as may mo≈øt ≈øeeme to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyre reply; but yet with ≈øuch faithfullnes, that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwerer ≈øhall haue no ju≈øt cau≈øe to complayne of the ≈øayd collections, as unju≈øt, or not agreeyng to his owne words. The marginall notes I will reply unto by them≈øelues, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4866:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> that according to the letters prefixed unto them: and the re≈øt that he writeth, in that order they are by him≈øelfe ≈øet downe.</p>
            <p>But before I proceede any further, let me admoni≈øh <hi>M. Powel</hi> of one fault in him, and common to many other of that ≈øide; that is to attribute that to all of vs which is done by any one. I meane in things which they thinke to be blameable. The≈øe Arguments were written by one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, yet what≈øoever he can by hooke or crooke gather as worthy of rebuke or ≈øhew of rebuke, that he imputeth to all that craue any favour? In good thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>gs they deale not ≈øo, but that which is well ≈øayd or done by one is imputed to one onely, ≈øo that the re≈øt fare not the better thereby. My humble de≈øire therfore is, that how≈øoever thes men deale with vs, yet that other would deale otherwi≈øe. viz. That if there be any thing blamable in the Arguments, or in any other one mans writing of our ≈øide, it may be taken as the fault onely of one, and not imputed to all. E≈øpecially let this be con≈øidered, when there is no fault at all, but onely by ≈øurmi≈øe, and upon uncharitable mi≈øcon≈øtruyng &amp; wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øting of a mans words. It was the fault of <hi>Saule,</hi> for the ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>po≈øed offence of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> to kill both him, and al≈øo all the re≈øt of the Lords Prei≈øts. It was the ≈øinne of <hi>Haman,</hi> for the ≈øu≈øpected pride of <hi>Mordecai</hi> in not bowyng unto him, to hate him &amp; all the Iewes, and to plot and contriue the ruine of them all. So the Apo≈øtle noteth it as a fault of the heathen, <hi>that knew not God, and were given over to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate mind, to take all things in the evill part.</hi> Rom. 1.24. Let this therefore be the ≈øinne of ≈øuch wicked men, but let all true Chri≈øtians that loue and feare the Lord, be free ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Now to proceed, I will beginne with the preface.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:4866:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>TOuching the preface there being not much therein which is not afterward mentioned in the re≈øt of the booke, I may the more cur≈øorily pa≈ø≈øe and rune it over.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt poynt here to be ob≈øerved, as al≈øo in the place of ≈øcripture ≈øub≈øcribed to the title <hi>Gen. 13.8.</hi> Is that he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs <hi>brethren,</hi> as if he did ≈øo account and regard us. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtandidg whether he doe any otherwi≈øe, or with any other minde ≈øo call us, then only as <hi>Ioab</hi> called <hi>Ama≈øae his brother</hi> with his mouth, and yet at the ≈øame in≈øtant killed him with his hand. 2 Sam. 20 9. I leaue it to be judged by his oppo≈øition to our petition, by his mo≈øt unchri≈øtian, &amp; vncharitable raylings, revilyngs, reproches &amp; ≈øcoffs, as al≈øo by his mo≈øt unju≈øt collections; as directly contrary to the words, &amp; much more to the meaning of the author of the ≈øaid Arguments, ≈øo likwi≈øe to all rea≈øon, &amp; common ≈øen≈øe. Sharpnes &amp; bitternes are the common weapons and prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipall armour of that ≈øide, which is an evidence of the bad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of their cau≈øe, and no le≈ø≈øe te≈øtimony of the goodnes of ours. For truth and righteou≈ønes can ≈øupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues without any ≈øuch meanes. Notwith≈øtanding in this kind, this an≈øwerer hath farre exceeded many other, yea, he may well be acknowledged to haue wonne the ≈øpurres from many other. They commonly object this fault unto us, and it may be ≈øome one of his private moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and di≈øpo≈øition, doth a litle ≈øomtyme offend this way, to the greife of the re≈øt that favor the cau≈øe. But if all ≈øpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of that kind that haue ever been u≈øed by any of our ≈øide, were gathered into one (truely and without any wre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>≈øting) they would not a mount to the number proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably, that is apparant and evident in this an≈øwer.</p>
            <p>The which fault is ≈øo much the greater, becau≈øe the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4866:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> are propounded with all temperance, &amp; without any ju≈øt occa≈øion to provoke him, except it be as a weake ≈øtomake is ≈øicke with the be≈øt and mo≈øt whol≈øome meate. Notwith≈øtandyng I do the le≈ø≈øe marveile hereat, becau≈øe as the more extreame the loue of <hi>Amnon</hi> was towardes <hi>Tamar</hi> at the fir≈øt, and the more extreame al≈øo his hatred again≈øt her afterward, <hi>2. Sam. 13.15.</hi> So this is often to be ob≈øerved, that ≈øuch as ≈øometime haue been mo≈øt hott in di≈ølike of the corruptions of our Church, they changing their minds and for preferment conformyng them≈øelues, haue become more bitter and heavie adver≈øaryes, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of tho≈øe that were never other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> conformable men. But was <hi>M. Powel</hi> at any time of ≈øuch a minde? Yea certain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly within the≈øe few yeares he was ≈øo over ≈øtrong, that he called the Communion booke a Ma≈ø≈ø booke. At another time likewi≈øe being at a Church, and hearing the Latiny, he ro≈øe up ≈øaying, come let us goe, what, ≈øhall we now heare conjuring? So likewi≈øe the time hath been when ≈øome other (now very conformable) haue publikly in pul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pit (I will not ≈øay in my hearing) to the di≈øgrace of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops ≈øayd, <hi>If ever the Bi≈øhops doe good in the Parliament hou≈øe let me be damned.</hi> Many other the like in≈øtances might be named, But I regard brevity. The≈øe things wilbe ju≈øtified. Did any of vs ever ≈øo be haue our ≈øelues? If we had, we might be ju≈øtly blamed in that behalfe. But I will pre≈ø≈øe this poynt no further. I haue the rather reported this, for the better an≈øwer of the matter of giddines afterward by him objected unto us.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The next poynt in the preface, is, that he chargeth us with emulation of forreyne novelty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈ø.</hi> Neither noveltie, nor forreyne. We de≈øire nothing, wherein we haue not proved our de≈øires by ≈øuch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4866:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> of Gods word (the be≈øt antiquitie, and be≈øides which, the more auncient any thing is, the more rotten is the ≈øame) ≈øuch arguments (I ≈øay) as never haue been yet ≈øufficiently an≈øwered. Touchinge the word <hi>forreyne,</hi> though indeed the thinges de≈øired by us are in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of other Countryes fully reformed in doctrine with ours, yet tho≈øe Churches being all the ≈øame hou≈øhould of faith that we are, they are not aptly called forreyne. As Engli≈øhmen travelyng in other Countryes and livyng af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Engli≈øh fa≈øhion, are not therfore Forreyners in re≈øpect of England whiles they ≈øo travell, but ≈øtill to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the ≈øame country, ≈øo all Churches and all members of the Church, in what Country ≈øo ever they be, are not to be accounted Forreyners one to another, becau≈øe they are all Citizens of heaven, and we make all one family or body.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides, the thinges in controver≈øie which we de≈øire to be removed, may much more ju≈øtly be called both <hi>Novil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> &amp; <hi>Forreyne,</hi> becau≈øe they were not of Apo≈øtolicall in≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, neyther heard of in the Apo≈øtles time, yea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by generall arguments in the writinges of the Apo≈øtles, as hath been ≈øhewed in divers other bookes written one our ≈øide, not yet an≈øwered: e≈øpecially in the A bridgment made by the Mini≈øters of <hi>Lincolne Dioce≈ø≈øe,</hi> the Demaunds, and in the 12 Arguments: as al≈øo becau≈øe they are in u≈øe in more Forreyne Popi≈øh Synagogues, then there are reformed Churches in all Europe. La≈øtly, although Communion with the Churches of Chri≈øt in what country ≈øoever, be much more to be re≈øpected, then fellow≈øhip with the ≈øinagogues of Antichri≈øt, yet we do not therefore de≈øire that which we doe, becau≈øe it is in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, but becau≈øe the word requyreth the ≈øame.</p>

               <p>His fir≈øt generall fraude is, that he ≈øetteth upon the≈øe Arguments, as though in them the mayne cau≈øe betwixt, the Prelats and vs were handled. Whereas the purpo≈øe of the author was not to informe the mindes and judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ts of the Parliament, but, taking that to be already done by other books written in that behalfe, &amp; the rather becau≈øe he did already ≈øee them to deale in the cau≈øe; he labored altogether, to quicken their affections, and to whet and encrea≈øe their zeale to be the more earne≈øt in that cau≈øe, of the equity and ≈øinceritie whereof, by former bookes touching their iudgments they were abundantlie infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and per≈øwaded. And heerin he had the more rea≈øon to provoke their godlie zeale, in re≈øpect of the manifold &amp; mightie adver≈øaries the cau≈øe had, and becau≈øe he knew that the ≈øayd adver≈øaryes wovld make ≈øtrong oppo≈øition therevnto and labor what they might to hinder the ≈øame. 2 Becau≈øe the mayne controver≈øie betwixt the Prelats and vs is not handled in the≈øe Arguments, therefore he in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>≈øulteth mightily, and often (almo≈øt in every page) he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth <hi>petitionem principii</hi> &amp; begging of the que≈øtion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, as though becau≈øe the controver≈øie were not hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the ≈øayd arguments, therefore it were not handled el≈øe where. But ≈øith it is handled by other who≈øe books &amp; rea≈øons are not yet an≈øwered, neither ever will be ≈øub≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, therefore this is but a vayne boa≈øting.</p>
               <p>His thyrd generall fraud is, that him≈øelfe committeth
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:4866:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> the ≈øame fault in all his an≈øwer, that he objecteth to the author of the arguments. For whereas the ≈øaid author vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ≈øufficient proofe made of the cau≈øe by other bookes, doeth make this the generall conclu≈øion of all the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that it would plea≈øe the whole State graciou≈øly to releeue the mini≈øters oppre≈ø≈øed for that cau≈øe etc: this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwerer maketh this his conclu≈øion, that it would plea≈øe the State to releeue the refractary and ≈øchi≈ømaticall Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters. So never prooving us, neither any other having e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proved us to be refractary, ≈øchi≈ømaticall etc. (except every Bi≈øhop be a <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and doe alwayes ≈øpeake ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which they ≈øeeldome doe) yet he taketh it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that we are ≈øuch. <hi>Huic areno≈øo fundamento tota ≈øtrues et moles ≈øequentis Praelatici re≈øpon≈øi innititur.

                        <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reply.</note>No paradox at all. Neither had the an≈øwerer any cau≈øe to make the two fir≈øt que≈øtions, if he had con≈øidered the places alleadged. That which he oppo≈øeth to the third a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt knowledge of the wi≈ødome of God by the go≈øpell etc: may as well be oppo≈øed to mens knowledge of the wi≈ødome of God by his word. For they are al≈øo taught the wi≈ødome of God by his creatures and works. <hi>p≈øa. 19.1 Rom. 1.1920.</hi> The further meanyng of this argument, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ≈øpeciall manner differing from other, I leaue to the au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thor him≈øelfe: who is able (no doubt) to defend his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, or ready to yeeld better rea≈øon to the contrary. But be it, that he had no other meanyng in this poynt then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men haue, yet the common doctrin of the ≈øcriptures
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4866:23" rendition="simple:additions"/> touching Angels in this behalfe, maketh the argument good. For the Angels of them≈øelues, know not who be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and who be reprobat. This knowledge before calling is proper to the Lord. <hi>2 Tim. 2.19.</hi> The election of men is made knowne to the Angels, by their calling and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, wherein it is ≈øayd the Angels rejoyce <hi>Luc. 15.7. &amp; 10.</hi> And ≈øo accordingly they glorifie God, in glorifiyng of whom con≈øi≈øteth their happines. The more therefore the word is preached, and men converted thereby, the more the Angels reioyce, and glorifie God: the le≈ø≈øe the word is preached, the le≈ø≈øe they rejoyce: yea, they may be ≈øayd in ≈øome ≈øort the more to mourne. In this re≈øpect therfore, the go≈øpell may be ≈øaid to be for the Angels. So this great paradox is unfolded. The ≈øub≈øtance of the ≈øecond parte of this an≈øwer to this 2 Argument hath been an≈øwered before. Whereas he chargeth us <hi>to for≈øake our mini≈øtery for a fewe pety accidentall circum≈øtances;</hi> therein he di≈øcovereth the nakednes of the Prelats, in inflicting ≈øo materiall and ≈øub≈øtantiall puni≈øhment, for a few pety accidentall circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances. For ju≈øtice requyreth a proportion betwixt the offence and the puni≈øhment. But we acknowledg no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.

                     <p>In his third an≈øwer he proclameth agayne, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not our error and faction.

                     <p>It is therefore erroniou≈øly alleadged, that that which was done by jurisdiction <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øticall,</hi> when <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> was granted, was not at that tyme taken to be done by the King, or by his authority, and that the lawes which <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øticall</hi> Iudges practi≈øed, were not then held, to be the lawes of the land, or the <hi>Kings</hi> lawes.

                        </note> which condemne ≈øuch ob≈øervation of dayes, and tymes.

For the weaknes of ≈øome mens body, at all tymes is ≈øuch, that they are not able to reade all and to preach. At ≈øometime al≈øo, the ≈øtronge≈øt man, may haue ≈øuch an infirmity, that he may not be able to endure the performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce of both. In winter, many times the extremity of cold, will not permit the whole audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to continue ≈øo long at Church. Then (will ≈øome ≈øay,) let preaching by ≈øuch per≈øons as are ≈øo weake, or at ≈øuch times, be omitted. This indeed is that which many would haue. But this is to performe bare reading before prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching: ignorance before knowledge: and the ordinances of man, before the commaundements of God.</p>

                     <p>And if by this <hi>Canon,</hi> the Kings will and grace, receiue let, hinderance, and prejudice; what ≈øhould we thinke, but that this <hi>Canon</hi> al≈øo tendeth, to the weakenyng of the Kings arme and power?

                     <p>And not onely is this 47. <hi>Canon,</hi> derogatorie to the Kings prerogatiue, but it is al≈øo repugnant, to other the Kings lawes and ≈øtatuts.
