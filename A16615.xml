         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE AND <hi>MOST CHRISTIAN HIGH COVRT OF</hi> PAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament which lately was, and ſhortly agayne is to be <hi>aſſembled.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>RIght Honorable and moſt Chriſtian Senat, as at your laſt Sesſion, there were certayne Arguments directed unto You for the quickening of your godly Zeale to ſpeake, not onely boldly, but alſo in all humilitie to the Kings moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Maieſtie, for the Miniſters ſuſpended and deprived for not Subſcribing and Conformyng themſelues to ſome preſent Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, and as ye did graciouſly accept of the ſayd Arguments, and moſt worthily acquite your ſelues to the utmoſt of your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, touching the matter pleaded for by them: ſo now vouchſafe (I moſt humblie beſeech you) the like favorable acceptance of a ſober, modeſt, and iuſt defence of the ſame Arguments againſt a late uncharitable, unchriſtian, bitter, calumnious, and cavilling anſwer, publiſhed under the title of <hi>A conſideration</hi> of them by <hi>M. Gabril Powel.</hi> I am bold in ſteed of the author himſelfe of the Arguments, to take the defence of them upon me, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them to your Honors, becauſe <hi>M. Powel</hi> himſelfe in his ſaid pretended anſwer unto them, hath ſo often referred the iudgment of the Arguments of his <hi>conſideration</hi> of them, and of the whole cauſe, to your moſt graue and gracious company. Yea, there is nothing that I am more willing unto, or which I doe more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire, then that the cauſe betwixt <hi>M. Powel</hi> and all thoſe for whom he pleadeth on the one parte, and the author of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and me the defendant with all other in whoſe behalfe we ſpeake on the other parte, might be iudiciouſſy and equally heard at the barre of your moſt <hi>Chriſtian Court.</hi> But the truth is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:4866:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> we deſire and endeavor this, <hi>hinc illae lacrymae.</hi> Hence is their chiefe hatred of us, their great contention with us, and their bitter writing againſt us. Notwithſtanding though now we be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly charged as writing from <hi>Cimerian</hi> darknes, for concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our names; yet if publike libertie might be granted to both parts, to ſtand before your iudgment ſeat, there freely to plead &amp; debate the cauſe by the word of God, and that neither the worldly might and pompe of our adverſaries, nor our meannes and baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes might be reſpected, but the truth it ſelfe ſimplie conſidered and regarded, we would alſo accoumpt it as a ſingular mercy of God, and as a ſpeciall favor of you towards us in that behalfe.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, I doe in all humility referr the Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, togeather with the defence of them to your graue and iudicious conſideration againſt your next meeting in Parliament: not doub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting but that the equitie of the cauſe, and the innocencie of our ſelues will therby be ſo apparant unto you, that though before ſom perhaps among you, did thinke the one not to be ſo iuſt, and the other not ſo free from all blame, yet when ye ſhall agayne aſſemble, ye will all with one mouth as one man, both iuſtifie the cauſe, and alſo ſpeake more then ever before ye haue don, for favor unto vs, and to our people: betwixt whom the bond before made by the Church, and ſealed by the holy Ghoſt in the effects of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, cannot by any Lordly Epiſcopall ſeverity be iuſtly diſſolved.</p>
            <p>I doe further likewiſe humblie craue your Honorable lawfull favor more ſpecially towards me (if at any time I ſhall be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered) againſt all thoſe that ſhall not well brooke the ſober and modeſt taxing of their corruptions in this defence: eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſame is not done of any contentious minde; but onely in loue of the truth, to ſupport it againſt thoſe that deprave it: and in regard of our owne good names, to mainteyne our owne in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nocency againſt thoſe that under the name of brethren, doe moſt unbrotherly diſgrace us.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:4866:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Moreover, if any thing in this defence following, or in the Arguments themſelues, by the malice of any ſhalbe wreſted and perverted, thereby alſo to wreſt and pervert the law to the danger of the ſeverall authors of the one or the other (being found out) may it likewiſe pleaſe you, in all lawfull and righteous manner to put forth your ſelues for protection of the ſayd authors: as chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe ſuch wreſting of words and perverting of iudgment, may procure Gods iudgments againſt themſelues that ſhall ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and againſt the whole land; ſo likewiſe becauſe to ſpeake in ſuch matters and for ſuch perſons (whatſoever the anſwerer ſaith to the contrary) ſhall not only bring much peace &amp; comfort to ſuch ſpeakers themſelues, but ſhall alſo be beneficiall to the whole land, as is ſhewed in the Arguments, nothing infringed or weakened, by all <hi>M. Powels</hi> oppoſition unto them.</p>
            <p>Yea let this conſideration be a third reaſon to moue you the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo to ſpeake, viz. that if one man had the divinity &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in law, as alſo all other learning, wit and wiſdom of all men, yet could he not ſo warily and circumſpectly write in all things, but that ſome wrangler or other (inſtructed and ſet a worke by the ſerpent, that is more ſubtle, not onely then all beaſts, but alſo then all men now living on the earth) might and would find ſome matter or other, wherby to moleſt and trouble him.</p>
            <p>I had thought much more to haue enlarged this my preface, but the prolixity of the defence it ſelfe much exceeded my firſt purpoſ, I will here conclude, both humblie and with all thanks to God &amp; to your ſelues acknowledging your moſt religious &amp; gracious endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors at your laſt Sesſion for the cauſe and for the perſons pleaded for in the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts; and moſt heartily &amp; inſtantly likewiſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for you &amp; yours as <hi>Nehemiah</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nehem: 5:19: &amp; 13:4:</note> prayed for himſelfe: viz. that <hi>God in goodnes would remember you</hi> (and yours) <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all that ye haue doone for vs: and that he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wype out your kindnes that ye haue ſhewed on the houſe of your God, and on the officers thereof.</hi>

            <head>
               <hi>A BREEFE NOTE OF SOME OF THE CHIEFE</hi> generall poynts handled in this defence following.</head>
            <p>THat the author of the Arguments is falſly accuſed to impute any diſſembling or equivocating to the Kings moſt excellent Majeſty, but that in all things he hath conceaved and written moſt reverently, Chriſtiantly and duetifully of his Majeſtie.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That he is as vntruely charged with any vndutifull ſpeeches againſt the Nobility, or any other that haue obeyed his Majeſties procedings</p>
            <p n="3">3 That the Miniſters pleaded for are not refractary, ſuperſtitious, or ſchiſmaticall: neyther confronters of the Magiſtrat, or troublers of the ſtate, but that theſe and other the like imputations doe rather belong to their accuſers</p>
            <p n="4">4 That our Churches of England are in nothing ſo glorious ſtate as is pretended by <hi>M. Powel,</hi> and other prelaticall perſons but rather in divers reſpects, and for divers parts <hi>thereof</hi> in lamentable condition.</p>
            <p n="5">5 That the late proceedings of the Prelats againſt ſuch Miniſters for not ſubſcribing, conforming etc: &amp; that many of the late <hi>Canons</hi> or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tutions are contrary to the word of God, &amp; the lawes of this Realme.</p>
            <p n="6">6 That the oth likewiſe <hi>Ex Officio</hi> is repugnant to the lawes of this Realme: yea abrogated by them, &amp; only inforced by forreyne Canons.</p>
            <p n="7">7 That the obedience &amp; loyaltie of the Miniſters for conſcience of Gods word not conforming themſelues, is as good as of the greateſt conformitans, yea that their not conforming the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in that reſpect, maketh more then conformity for the good &amp; ſafetie of his Majeſtie.</p>
            <p n="8">8 That the Conſiderer of the arguments, in his inconſiderat conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them, hath moſt unreverently and undutifully cenſured the High Court of Parliament, for their late moſt religious indeavors in behalfe of the Miniſters pleaded for in the ſayd Arguments.</p>
            <p n="9">9 That the Miniſters ſoe deprived, doe not forſake their callings.</p>
            <p n="10">10 That although the number of the Miniſters ſo deprived be but ſmal in compariſon of other, yet the deprivation of them &amp; the loſſ of their Miniſtery is dangerous for the whole Church in this kingdome.</p>
            <p n="11">11 That the Conſiderer of the arguments ofttimes offendeth in thos things which unjuſtly he objecteth unto the author of the arguments: viz: in ſophiſtications in generall, and particularly in begging of the queſtion: as alſo in equivocations, &amp; in vayne repetitions of the ſame things for encreaſing of his volume: and laſtly incontradicting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, yea ſometyme in one and the ſame place.</p>
            <p n="12">12 That he and other the Prelats moſt ſtriving for conformity, doe attribut more to conformitie, then to any more materiall &amp; principall duties of the Miniſtery expreſly commanded by God.</p>

            <p>Heerein (notwithſtanding the anſwerer his ſcoffing at our triobular Pamphlets) I will labour as much as I may for brevity, that ſo the Chriſtian reader may the leſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hindred from his other waighty affayres. For this cauſe I nether will reply to the whole anſwer, neither will cauſe the ſayd anſwer to be wholly reprinted, but will onely moſt breifly collect ſuch things, as may moſt ſeeme to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyre reply; but yet with ſuch faithfullnes, that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer ſhall haue no juſt cauſe to complayne of the ſayd collections, as unjuſt, or not agreeyng to his owne words. The marginall notes I will reply unto by themſelues, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4866:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> that according to the letters prefixed unto them: and the reſt that he writeth, in that order they are by himſelfe ſet downe.</p>
            <p>But before I proceede any further, let me admoniſh <hi>M. Powel</hi> of one fault in him, and common to many other of that ſide; that is to attribute that to all of vs which is done by any one. I meane in things which they thinke to be blameable. Theſe Arguments were written by one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, yet whatſoever he can by hooke or crooke gather as worthy of rebuke or ſhew of rebuke, that he imputeth to all that craue any favour? In good thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs they deale not ſo, but that which is well ſayd or done by one is imputed to one onely, ſo that the reſt fare not the better thereby. My humble deſire therfore is, that howſoever thes men deale with vs, yet that other would deale otherwiſe. viz. That if there be any thing blamable in the Arguments, or in any other one mans writing of our ſide, it may be taken as the fault onely of one, and not imputed to all. Eſpecially let this be conſidered, when there is no fault at all, but onely by ſurmiſe, and upon uncharitable miſconſtruyng &amp; wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of a mans words. It was the fault of <hi>Saule,</hi> for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſed offence of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> to kill both him, and alſo all the reſt of the Lords Preiſts. It was the ſinne of <hi>Haman,</hi> for the ſuſpected pride of <hi>Mordecai</hi> in not bowyng unto him, to hate him &amp; all the Iewes, and to plot and contriue the ruine of them all. So the Apoſtle noteth it as a fault of the heathen, <hi>that knew not God, and were given over to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate mind, to take all things in the evill part.</hi> Rom. 1.24. Let this therefore be the ſinne of ſuch wicked men, but let all true Chriſtians that loue and feare the Lord, be free ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Now to proceed, I will beginne with the preface.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:4866:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>TOuching the preface there being not much therein which is not afterward mentioned in the reſt of the booke, I may the more curſorily paſſe and rune it over.</p>
            <p>The firſt poynt here to be obſerved, as alſo in the place of ſcripture ſubſcribed to the title <hi>Gen. 13.8.</hi> Is that he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs <hi>brethren,</hi> as if he did ſo account and regard us. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandidg whether he doe any otherwiſe, or with any other minde ſo call us, then only as <hi>Ioab</hi> called <hi>Amaſae his brother</hi> with his mouth, and yet at the ſame inſtant killed him with his hand. 2 Sam. 20 9. I leaue it to be judged by his oppoſition to our petition, by his moſt unchriſtian, &amp; vncharitable raylings, revilyngs, reproches &amp; ſcoffs, as alſo by his moſt unjuſt collections; as directly contrary to the words, &amp; much more to the meaning of the author of the ſaid Arguments, ſo likwiſe to all reaſon, &amp; common ſenſe. Sharpnes &amp; bitternes are the common weapons and prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipall armour of that ſide, which is an evidence of the bad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of their cauſe, and no leſſe teſtimony of the goodnes of ours. For truth and righteouſnes can ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues without any ſuch meanes. Notwithſtanding in this kind, this anſwerer hath farre exceeded many other, yea, he may well be acknowledged to haue wonne the ſpurres from many other. They commonly object this fault unto us, and it may be ſome one of his private moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diſpoſition, doth a litle ſomtyme offend this way, to the greife of the reſt that favor the cauſe. But if all ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of that kind that haue ever been uſed by any of our ſide, were gathered into one (truely and without any wre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſting) they would not a mount to the number proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably, that is apparant and evident in this anſwer.</p>
            <p>The which fault is ſo much the greater, becauſe the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4866:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> are propounded with all temperance, &amp; without any juſt occaſion to provoke him, except it be as a weake ſtomake is ſicke with the beſt and moſt wholſome meate. Notwithſtandyng I do the leſſe marveile hereat, becauſe as the more extreame the loue of <hi>Amnon</hi> was towardes <hi>Tamar</hi> at the firſt, and the more extreame alſo his hatred againſt her afterward, <hi>2. Sam. 13.15.</hi> So this is often to be obſerved, that ſuch as ſometime haue been moſt hott in diſlike of the corruptions of our Church, they changing their minds and for preferment conformyng themſelues, haue become more bitter and heavie adverſaryes, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe that were never other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conformable men. But was <hi>M. Powel</hi> at any time of ſuch a minde? Yea certain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly within theſe few yeares he was ſo over ſtrong, that he called the Communion booke a Maſſ booke. At another time likewiſe being at a Church, and hearing the Latiny, he roſe up ſaying, come let us goe, what, ſhall we now heare conjuring? So likewiſe the time hath been when ſome other (now very conformable) haue publikly in pul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pit (I will not ſay in my hearing) to the diſgrace of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſayd, <hi>If ever the Biſhops doe good in the Parliament houſe let me be damned.</hi> Many other the like inſtances might be named, But I regard brevity. Theſe things wilbe juſtified. Did any of vs ever ſo be haue our ſelues? If we had, we might be juſtly blamed in that behalfe. But I will preſſe this poynt no further. I haue the rather reported this, for the better anſwer of the matter of giddines afterward by him objected unto us.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The next poynt in the preface, is, that he chargeth us with emulation of forreyne novelty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Neither noveltie, nor forreyne. We deſire nothing, wherein we haue not proved our deſires by ſuch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4866:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> of Gods word (the beſt antiquitie, and beſides which, the more auncient any thing is, the more rotten is the ſame) ſuch arguments (I ſay) as never haue been yet ſufficiently anſwered. Touchinge the word <hi>forreyne,</hi> though indeed the thinges deſired by us are in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of other Countryes fully reformed in doctrine with ours, yet thoſe Churches being all the ſame houſhould of faith that we are, they are not aptly called forreyne. As Engliſhmen travelyng in other Countryes and livyng af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Engliſh faſhion, are not therfore Forreyners in reſpect of England whiles they ſo travell, but ſtill to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the ſame country, ſo all Churches and all members of the Church, in what Country ſo ever they be, are not to be accounted Forreyners one to another, becauſe they are all Citizens of heaven, and we make all one family or body.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the thinges in controverſie which we deſire to be removed, may much more juſtly be called both <hi>Novil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> &amp; <hi>Forreyne,</hi> becauſe they were not of Apoſtolicall inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, neyther heard of in the Apoſtles time, yea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by generall arguments in the writinges of the Apoſtles, as hath been ſhewed in divers other bookes written one our ſide, not yet anſwered: eſpecially in the A bridgment made by the Miniſters of <hi>Lincolne Dioceſſe,</hi> the Demaunds, and in the 12 Arguments: as alſo becauſe they are in uſe in more Forreyne Popiſh Synagogues, then there are reformed Churches in all Europe. Laſtly, although Communion with the Churches of Chriſt in what country ſoever, be much more to be reſpected, then fellowſhip with the ſinagogues of Antichriſt, yet we do not therefore deſire that which we doe, becauſe it is in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, but becauſe the word requyreth the ſame.</p>

In things truely indifferent, it is already juſtified, and ſhalbe further juſtified (if neede requyer) that we attribute no leſſe to the magiſtrat, then our adverſaryes doe. Let them name in what ſenſe and de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gree the Papiſts deny the Soveraignty of Princes in any thinge, and I doubt not, but that it may be proved that themſelues (holding their owne principles) doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the ſame, in the ſame ſenſe and degree.</p>

There is none of theſe of whom you ſpeake, but for the world and outward things they might liue better conformyng then not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forming themſelues. What benefit haue any by gratifying their Patrons? Will their Patrons giue them better mayntenance otherwiſe? Nay ſome Patrons are their adverſaryes, and are gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them that put ſuch Miniſters out, that ſo they may preſent againe etc. Some ſo diſpleaſe their frends heerby
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4866:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> that by their diſpleaſure they looſe more in one day then they get all their life by any Eccleſiaſticall living. Some alſo by diſpleaſing their frends doe not only loſe tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall benefits for them and theirs, but doe alſo hinder them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues of as great Eccleſiaſticall promotion, as many or the moſt of the conformable ſort doe ateyne unto. Some by their troubles for this cauſe, having had good patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes: haue conſumed &amp; waſted them ſo, that in their age (when they need moſt comfort) they liue in penury and want, and at their death leaue not ſo much to their wiues &amp; many children, as was left to themſelues alone.

Agayne, this imputation of carnall reſpects unto us (ſuch as you reckon) is contrary to your often imputation of ſuperſtition unto vs. For what is ſuperſtition, but to make that ſinne that is not ſinne; and ſo to feare ſinnyng againſt God, as that we doe not that which lawfully we may do: or one the contrary to make that good, holy, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that is nether good, holy, nor neceſſary, and ſo to think himſelfe bound to doe that, which well he might leaue undone? If then we be ſuperſtitious, and doe that which we doe in fearing to ſinne againſt God, how can ſuch car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reſpects as before are particularized, be imputed vnto us? But the truth is, that theſe carnall reſpects doe belong rather to conformiry, for which many will doe any thing rather then they will looſe their livyngs. Of how many alſo of them may it be ſayd <hi>that they ſeeke their owne, and not that which is Ieſus Chriſts?</hi> Philip. 2.21.

For we follow not Chriſt, neither walke with him any longer, then we doe obſerue his word. Further alſo

               <p>Concernyng the Arguments themſelues, may it pleaſe the Chriſtian reader firſt of all to take a generall veiwe of the generall fraudes of the anſwerer in his anſwer vnto them.</p>
               <p>His firſt generall fraude is, that he ſetteth upon theſe Arguments, as though in them the mayne cauſe betwixt, the Prelats and vs were handled. Whereas the purpoſe of the author was not to informe the mindes and judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the Parliament, but, taking that to be already done by other books written in that behalfe, &amp; the rather becauſe he did already ſee them to deale in the cauſe; he labored altogether, to quicken their affections, and to whet and encreaſe their zeale to be the more earneſt in that cauſe, of the equity and ſinceritie whereof, by former bookes touching their iudgments they were abundantlie infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and perſwaded. And heerin he had the more reaſon to provoke their godlie zeale, in reſpect of the manifold &amp; mightie adverſaries the cauſe had, and becauſe he knew that the ſayd adverſaryes wovld make ſtrong oppoſition therevnto and labor what they might to hinder the ſame. 2 Becauſe the mayne controverſie betwixt the Prelats and vs is not handled in theſe Arguments, therefore he in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſulteth mightily, and often (almoſt in every page) he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth <hi>petitionem principii</hi> &amp; begging of the queſtion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, as though becauſe the controverſie were not hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the ſayd arguments, therefore it were not handled elſe where. But ſith it is handled by other whoſe books &amp; reaſons are not yet anſwered, neither ever will be ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, therefore this is but a vayne boaſting.</p>
               <p>His thyrd generall fraud is, that himſelfe committeth
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:4866:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> the ſame fault in all his anſwer, that he objecteth to the author of the arguments. For whereas the ſaid author vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſufficient proofe made of the cauſe by other bookes, doeth make this the generall concluſion of all the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that it would pleaſe the whole State graciouſly to releeue the miniſters oppreſſed for that cauſe etc: this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer maketh this his concluſion, that it would pleaſe the State to releeue the refractary and ſchiſmaticall Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. So never prooving us, neither any other having e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proved us to be refractary, ſchiſmaticall etc. (except every Biſhop be a <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and doe alwayes ſpeake ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which they ſeeldome doe) yet he taketh it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that we are ſuch. <hi>Huic arenoſo fundamento tota ſtrues et moles ſequentis Praelatici reſponſi innititur.

Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd: they never ſinned: or that they might learne to knowe the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God? So they doe by all other creaturs, and actions of God:</q>

                        <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reply.</note>No paradox at all. Neither had the anſwerer any cauſe to make the two firſt queſtions, if he had conſidered the places alleadged. That which he oppoſeth to the third a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt knowledge of the wiſdome of God by the goſpell etc: may as well be oppoſed to mens knowledge of the wiſdome of God by his word. For they are alſo taught the wiſdome of God by his creatures and works. <hi>pſa. 19.1 Rom. 1.1920.</hi> The further meanyng of this argument, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpeciall manner differing from other, I leaue to the au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thor himſelfe: who is able (no doubt) to defend his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, or ready to yeeld better reaſon to the contrary. But be it, that he had no other meanyng in this poynt then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men haue, yet the common doctrin of the ſcriptures
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4866:23" rendition="simple:additions"/> touching Angels in this behalfe, maketh the argument good. For the Angels of themſelues, know not who be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and who be reprobat. This knowledge before calling is proper to the Lord. <hi>2 Tim. 2.19.</hi> The election of men is made knowne to the Angels, by their calling and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, wherein it is ſayd the Angels rejoyce <hi>Luc. 15.7. &amp; 10.</hi> And ſo accordingly they glorifie God, in glorifiyng of whom conſiſteth their happines. The more therefore the word is preached, and men converted thereby, the more the Angels reioyce, and glorifie God: the leſſe the word is preached, the leſſe they rejoyce: yea, they may be ſayd in ſome ſort the more to mourne. In this reſpect therfore, the goſpell may be ſaid to be for the Angels. So this great paradox is unfolded. The ſubſtance of the ſecond parte of this anſwer to this 2 Argument hath been anſwered before. Whereas he chargeth us <hi>to forſake our miniſtery for a fewe pety accidentall circumſtances;</hi> therein he diſcovereth the nakednes of the Prelats, in inflicting ſo materiall and ſubſtantiall puniſhment, for a few pety accidentall circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. For juſtice requyreth a proportion betwixt the offence and the puniſhment. But we acknowledg no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. For we may not purchaſe liberty of doing the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt good, with committing the leaſt evill. He that ſaith doe good, firſt ſaith, <hi>eſchew evill.</hi> pſal. 34.14.

This poynt is not lightly to be regarded: yea, it is of great moment. For the Apoſtle deſcribeth ſchiſmatikes, not to be ſuch, <hi>as make diviſion onely,</hi> but he addeth, <hi>contrary to the doctrine which they had learned.</hi> Rom. 16.17. Yea in the very next verſe he deſcribeth them further, ſaying, <hi>They that are ſuch ſerue not the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, but their owne bellyes, and with faire ſpeeches, and flattering, diceaue the hearts of the ſimple.</hi> Doe we ſo? Nay rather we labour onely for the ordinances, which the Apoſtle hath taught vs. In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4866:27" rendition="simple:additions"/> we <hi>ſerue not our owne bellyes,</hi> but rather for thoſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances ſake, and to ſerue the Lord Ieſus by them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto them, we depriue our owne bellyes of that which otherwiſe they might haue; neither <hi>doe we vſe faire ſpeeches, and flattering, but by playne dealing</hi> for thoſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt Ieſus, we procure the diſpleaſure of all men againſt us. As therefore this place maketh for vs, and evidently ſheweth vs to be no ſchiſmatikes, ſo likewiſe it doth as plainely proue them to be ſchiſmatikes that <hi>make diviſion</hi> for humane inventions, either in doctrine, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in practiſe in the worſhip of God, contrary to thoſe things which they haue learned from the Apoſtle; who alſo therein, <hi>ſerue not the Lord Ieſus, but their owne bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes, vſing faire wordes and flattering</hi> in that behalfe <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue</hi> not onely <hi>the ſimple,</hi> but alſo if it be posſible, them that are wiſe.</p>
                     <p>Agayne haue we made any departure from the Church? We are deprived of our Miniſtery, and ſo thruſt out of our lyvinges, perforce againſt our wills, as any man lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that which is violently taken away: but though we be thus put from our miniſtery and lyvinges by our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats, yet we do not forſake the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the Church. The cauſe alſo why we are put out, is not for reſpect of our ſelues, but for feare of ſinnyng againſt God, and of aggravating the burden of our owne conſcience therby. <hi>We diſturb not the ſincere profesſion of the goſpell, and worke of the miniſtery,</hi> but in all humilitie, and with the wordes of ſobriety, we condemne the corruptions of our profesſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and of the miniſtery, moſt duetifully and by all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes (and no other) deſiring both to be reformed, according to Gods word. So in like manner we deſire to be eaſed of thoſe cloggs, which hinder both us in the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4866:27" rendition="simple:additions"/> worke of the miniſtery, and alſo the people ſo, that they neither doe, neither can ſo edifie themſelues in their moſt holy faith, as otherwiſe they and we would doe. On the contrary, the Prelats ſtoutly mayntaine and ſupport the ſayd corruptions, and in loue of them (or rather of ſome other matter depending upon them) they hate and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt us.</p>
                     <p>Agayne haue we loytred in the worke of the miniſtery? Haue we heaped benefice upon benefice? Haue we eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and drunke, and beaten our fellow ſervants? Haue we ſought our owne, &amp; not that which is Ieſus Chriſts? <hi>Phil. 2.21. Haue we made our bellyes our God? Haue we minded earth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly things?</hi> philip. 3.19. I ſpeake not theſe things boaſtingly (as before we haue been charged) but onely to purge our ſelues of thoſe crimes, which the former two notes did caſt upon us, and to proue that we haue not been diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers but furtheres of the ſincere profesſion of the goſpell, and worke of the Miniſtery. Therfore let them that do ſo vntruely accuſe us, take heed that he (whoſe checke no fleeſh ſhall be able to indure) doe not charge them, rather <hi>to haue taken away the key of knowledge, and to haue shut vp the Kingdome of heaven before men, not goeyng in themſelues, neither ſuffering them that would enter, to come in. Mat. 23.13.</hi> whereas alſo the word <hi>Schiſme</hi> in the Greeke language ſignifieth a renting, and the word <hi>ſedition</hi> in the latine tongue ſignifieth <hi>ſeorſim ire,</hi> to goe aſide or, a going a ſide: as we haue proved that in theſe ſignifications, we cannot be juſtly charged with them, ſo let them that doe charge vs in this behalfe ſee and conſider well, whether them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues may not more truely be ſayde to haue rent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and to haue gone a ſide, firſt from the word (the rule of all Churches) in the poyntes of doctrine before
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:4866:28" rendition="simple:additions"/> mentioned, and in ſome other, as alſo in the obſerving &amp; maynteyning of humaine Ceremonyes in the worſhip of God: 2 From other Churches of Chriſt Ieſus: both the auncient Apoſtolicall Churches, and alſo the preſent Churches reformed in other Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tryes: nether of which either held or doe hold ſuch poynts of doctrine as before I haue named: or haue or doe obſerue &amp; maintayne ſuch humaine Ceremonyes in the worſhip of God, as are here in queſtion. We beyng charged with hereſye &amp; ſchiſme by the Papiſts for renouncyng the doctrine and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the preſent Romiſh Synagogue, doe truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne the ſame charge upon the papiſts touching heriſie and ſchiſme, becauſe they haue fallen away from the doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trine and auncient ſimplicitie in the worſhip of God, that at the beginnynge was in the Auncient Romane Church, and in other true Churches, planted by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. In like mannner therefore let our accuſers in the feare of God conſider, whither the blame of ſchiſme doe not for the cauſes before expreſſed, more aptly belonge unto them, then to vs etc.</p>
                     <p>Let me yet alſo (though ſomewhat perhaps out of place) ad one reaſon more, to proue the Miniſters pleaded for, not to be Schiſmatikes.</p>
                     <p>All Schiſmatikes are abomination to the Lord: The Miniſters pleaded for: are not abomination to the Lord, but in grace and favour with him, <hi>Ergo:</hi> The Miniſters pleaded for, are no Schiſmatikes. The propoſition or firſt parte of the Argument, is <hi>Salomons,</hi> who among the ſixe thinges which the Lord hateth, and the ſeven which the ſoule of the Lord abhorreth, he reckoneth <hi>him that ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth up contention among brethren.</hi> The aſſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or ſecond part of the former Argument is granted by the anſwerer
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4866:28" rendition="simple:additions"/> anſwerer himſelfe in his anſwer to the firſt Argument: yea it is manifeſt by the good ſucceſſe of their miniſtery from God in the ſayd Argument mentioned. Yea, and that this argument from the blesſing of God upon their miniſtery, is of force, and much to be reſpected, appereth by the words of the blind man reported with commenda<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion by <hi>S. Iohn. This is a mervelous thing that ye know not whence he is, and yet he hath opened myne eyes. Now we know that God heareth not ſinners; but if any man be a worſhipper of God, and doth his will, him heareth he.</hi> And verſe 33. <hi>If this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were not of God, he could haue done nothing.</hi> Was this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t good from the opennyng of the eyes of the body of one that was borne bodily blind, and is it not much ſtronger: from the openyng of the eyes of the minde of many that are borne ſpiritually blind?</p>
                     <p>The further anſwer of <hi>M. Powel</hi> to this third Argument conteyneth nothing, but that which is partely anſwered before, and partly to be anſwered afterward. Therefore I paſſe the ſame by and come to the 4 argument.</p>

                        <hi>and haue neede of nothing:</hi> but this I ſay, that all beyng granted that you ſay, doth not hinder but further the cauſe. The more the Church floriſheth, the more eaſie it is to grant that, which the Arguments pleade for. Miniſters alſo of the word, are as neceſſary for the preſerving and increaſing of the glorie of Churches, as for the procuring therof at the firſt. But alas I would God our Church did ſo floriſh as you pretend. Indeed it hath many rich mercyes, God be bleſſed for them; but he that ſeeth not what the Church wanteth, doth not rightly acknowledge that which it hath. Is this the glory of a Church for Prelates to floriſh
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4866:34" rendition="simple:additions"/> and flant it out gallantly: and for their men to ruffle it out luſtily? Nay rather, this is the glory of the world, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beſeeming the Courts of Princes, and houſes of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men, then the calling of <hi>orthodox Biſhops,</hi> who ſhould as well in their life as in their doctrine, preach humilitie, modeſtie, and contempt of the world. The more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that Prelats are outwardly, the leſſe glorious (for the moſt part) they are inwardly. Yea it is to be obſerved, that the more the outward glory of Churchmen (as they are called) hath increaſed, the more hath true &amp; inward glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry decayed. The more alſo, that the inward and true bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church hath decayed, the more hath the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtate and pompe of the officers thereof increaſed. When were the Preiſts of the law, of greater outward au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and tooke more upon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then when the church of the Iewes touching true beuty, was in worſt caſe? <hi>Serch the ſcriptures for they beare witnes heerof.</hi> Yea, were there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many degrees of dignitie in the Church, and doe we ever reade of ſo great ſtate and pompe of the Preiſtes in the former tymes, as there was of the Preiſts, Scribes &amp; Phariſes at the firſt commyng of Chriſt? And were ever things in ſo bad caſe before, as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were? So alſo ſinc that, the more that truth of doctrine, and puritie of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline decayed in the Church, after the golden and moſt glorious age of the Apoſtles, the more did the Church grow unto, and ſwell in outward riches, pomp and glory. Experience alſo teacheth, that the more glorious Prelats are in their outward ſtate, the leſſe benefite the reſt of the Church hath by them; becauſe they take the leſſ paynes; at the leaſt, ſuch paynes, as are moſt agreable to the true Epiſcopall and miniſteriall calling, deſcribed in holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture. Wherein then is the true glory of the Church? 1 in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4866:34" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſuch miniſters of the word and other officers; as Chriſt hath commended. 2 In the performance of ſuch dutyes by them, as he requyreth, that is in preaching the word faithfully, in adminiſtring the Sacraments ſincerely, in praying zealouſly and aptly according to the necesſityes of the Church, and in executyng Diſcipline wiſely, and juſtly: 3 In the effects of the former two, viz: in true knowledge, faith, loue, zeale, humility, patience, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, righteouſnes, peace, etc. Touching theſe thinges, the more we want ſom of thoſe officers that Chriſt hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended by his Apoſtles to the Church, and the more negligent thoſe that we haue are in their duties, the more lamentable it is to ſee the carved pillers of the temple broken downe, and the faithfull workmen in Gods houſe to be caſt out, by whoſe labors it had been before built &amp; brought to ſome good bewty. Touching the laſt, what chriſtian heart is ſo ſtony, that it doth not mourne? What eye ſo drye, that it doth not ſhead teares, yea rather, guſh out with teares, to conſider and behold, the meſery of our ſuppoſed glorious Church, by the ſpirituall nakednes, blindnes &amp; poverty therof? I meane the great ignorance, the ſuperficiall worſhip of God, the fearfull blaſphemies and ſwaringes in houſes, and ſtreates, ſo alſo the direfull curſings, the open contempt of the word &amp; Sacraments, the wicked profanations of the Lords dayes, the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of ſuperiours, the pride, the cruelty, the fornications, adultryes, and other uncleanneſſes, the dronkennes, the covetouſnes, the uſuryes, and other the like abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, almoſt as grevous as either heertofore in the tyme, or now in the places of Popery, when, and where, there was no preaching at all of the goſpell? O <hi>M. Powel,</hi> and yee my Reverend Fathers, and brethren in the miniſtery (even of

Were the faithfull and paynfull Preiſts and Levites, ſo urged to the obſervation of mens traditions and Ceremonyes in the worſhip of God, and otherwiſe ſo moleſted, as now many godly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are?

                        <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reply.</note>Touching the former anſwer, may it pleaſe the reader, firſt to remember, that all the authors ſpeech of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Biſhops againſt Miniſters ſuſpended etc: is only to be underſtood of ſuch Miniſters, as whom they ſuſpend and depriue, onely for ſuch cauſes as are menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the title of the Argumentes, not of other whom they ſuſpend or depriue for any juſt cauſe. Now to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, that ſuch Miniſters haue not yet in law (whereof the preſent queſtion is) juſtified there cauſe, and declared that they are unjuſtly oppreſſed, nor can ever doe, is not for want of matter of juſtification, or for want of the truth of unjuſt oppresſion (I meane only by the Prelats) but becauſe they haue not been admitted, to proſecute the iuſtice of the land, nor to call in queſtion the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of their ordinaryes: who haue been hitherto both Agents and Iudges; both accuſers and advocats in their owne caſes againſt them. And eſpecially becauſe upon
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:4866:43" rendition="simple:additions"/> pretenſe of a <hi>Canon</hi> lately made, (repugnant to the lawes, ſtatutes; and cuſtomes of the Realme) they be not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the <hi>Archbiſhops Iudge ad quem,</hi> to plead and to proſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cute their appeales, and to declare their innocency accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the auncient laudable, and common uſage and iuſtice of the land: unto which grevance alſo many more exorbitant injuſtices (by the Prelats) heereafter mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned may be added. Let the anſwerer therfore vnderſtand, that ſom Ordinaryes in their publike ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces,<note place="margin">The Biſhop of Lincolne againſt the the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire.</note> haue moſt uniuſtly charged ſome Miniſters, with denyall of the oth to the Kings ſupremacy: which notwithſtanding, divers tymes before, they had willingly ſworne vnto, and which at the very inſtance of pronouncyng the ſentence, they offred before their Ordinary to ſweare unto agayne. And not onely thus leſingly, (to make the Perſons of the ſayd Miniſters more odious to our moſt Chriſtian King, his State, and all his people) in their publike ſentences of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation, have ſom Ordinaryes traduced the good name and eſtimation of the Miniſters, but alſo without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeciall crime worthy deprivation me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned in their ſentences, haue they ſtuſſed their ſentences full, only with generall wordes of generall crimes, contrary to the right forme of judgment.

How many ſentences therefore of deprivation ſoever, as haue been lately given without due and juſt matter, or without due and iuſt forme, we anſwer ſo many not to haue paſſed in due matter and forme, and ſo contrary to ſome lawes or ſtatuts.

                     <p>That which followeth in the 2. 3. and 4. branches of this 4 anſwer to the conſequence of this 8 Argument, doth not belong to the matter, becauſe it doth nothing juſtifie the proceedings of the Biſhops or other Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Iudges, in depriving of the Miniſters pleaded for, in ſuch manner and for ſuch cauſes, as for which they haue depriveded them. The queſtion is not whether ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction Eccleſiaſticall by the lawes of the land doth be long (under the King) unto the ordinaryes: nor whether the Ordinaryes in the exerciſe of the Kings jurisdiction Eccleſiiaſticall, and Conſiſtoriall trialls, ought to proceed by vertue of <hi>Peeres,</hi> etc: but whether ſome Ordinaryes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing the <hi>Kings Eccleſiaſticall</hi> jurisdiction, haue procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in their <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Conſiſtories,</hi> againſt ſome Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, without authority of the <hi>Kings Eccleſiaſticall law:</hi> &amp; therfore in that reſpect, contrary to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which requyreth nothing to be doone without the Kings law.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:4866:50" rendition="simple:additions"/> lawes of England: yet I deny that all lawes Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>call, derived by the Kings progenitors, either before or ſince the Conqueſt from others, are now in this age our Soveraigne Lord <hi>King Iames</hi> his Eccleſiaſticall lawes: and therefore howſoever many judiciall Acts of deprivation, of Biſhops &amp; Preiſts, from their benefices &amp;c. according to the Eccleſiaſticall law, which is called <hi>ius Pontificium,</hi> &amp; which was derived, by the Kings Progenitors, from the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> either before, or ſince the Conqueſt, unto <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and ſince that, to the 25 of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eyght, were never, all held, to be contrary, but were ever all held, to be agreable to the lawes of this kingdome: yet notwithſtanding, I affirme that all Iudiciall Acts and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,<note place="margin">25. Hen. 8 cap. 17</note> (how many ſoever, of deprivation of Miniſters, from their benefices) had made and given, by the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Iudges, ſince the 25. of <hi>King Henry</hi> the 8. onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording, or onely by force, and vertue of the ſayd <hi>ius Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificium,</hi> or <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> his law, (the ſentences given in the time of <hi>Queene Mary</hi> excepted) are, and ought to be holden, not to be had, made &amp; given, by the lawes of this kingdome, or by the Kings Eccleſiaſticall law: And why? Even becauſe the whole <hi>ius Pontificium,</hi> or <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Romes</hi> law was altogether (excepting the tyme of <hi>Queene Mary</hi>) abrogated, <hi>adnulled,</hi> and made voyd, by an Act of Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and conſequently is but a meere <hi>Alien, Forraine and ſtraunge law,</hi> and no municipall law of <hi>England,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not the Kings Eccleſiaſticall law.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore our Soveraigne Lord <hi>King Iames,</hi> by this graunt of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> made by his progenitors, beyng obliged, to ſuffer no Free man of the Realme, to be taken or impriſoned, or diſſeiſſed of his Frrehold, or liberties, &amp;c. Nor to paſſe upon him nor condemne him, but by
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:4866:50" rendition="simple:additions"/> lawfull judgment of his <hi>Peeres,</hi> or by the law of the land. We agayne aſſume from this ſtatute of the great <hi>Charter,</hi> that ſundry ſentences of deprivation of Miniſters, from their benefices, for cauſes before ſpecified, are unlawfull; becauſe ſuch Miniſters haue been condemned, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath been paſſed upon them, without lawfull judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their <hi>Peeres,</hi> or law Eccleſiaſticall of the land. For heere we muſt giue the anſwerer to witt, by theſe words, (or law of the land,) that all the Kings lawes, of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or quality ſoever, whether Eccleſiaſticall or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and not only the lawes temporall, (as he inſinuateth) are included. As therefore no temporall Free man of the Realme, may be condemned, paſſed upon, or diſſeiſſed of his liberty, and freehold, &amp;c. in a temporall cauſe, and in a temporall Court, without lawfull judgment of his <hi>Peeres,</hi> or temporall law of the land. Even ſo likewiſe, no Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall perſon, (beyng a freeman of the Realme) may be condemned, paſſed upon, or diſſeiſſed of his liberty, or fre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hold, but by lawfull Eccleſiaſticall judgement, according to the law <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> of the land. And heereupon we graunt, if the King haue any law Eccleſiaſticall of the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, for the deprivation of a Miniſter, from his liberty and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, for not ſubſcription, perjurie, contempt of <hi>Canonical</hi> (ſo called <hi>obedience,</hi> omisſion of Rites, and Ceremonyes, not preciſe obſervation of the booke of Common prayer &amp;c. Then we graunt, that the Ordinaryes (being the Kings Iudges Eccleſiaſticall) may rightly depriue a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter from his benefice, for theſe offences.</p>
                     <p>And yet ſtill we deny, and ſhall be able to mainteyne, that ſundry ſentences of deprivation, made and given, by ſundry Ordinaries, againſt ſvndry Miniſters, be either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt or unlawfull; or no ſentences at all, for the reaſons and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:4866:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> cauſes before ſpecified.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore erroniouſly alleadged, that that which was done by jurisdiction <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> when <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> was granted, was not at that tyme taken to be done by the King, or by his authority, and that the lawes which <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Iudges practiſed, were not then held, to be the lawes of the land, or the <hi>Kings</hi> lawes. For the <hi>Kings</hi> progenitors, did both thinke and held, that jurisdiction <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> did in right belong unto their Crowe, and therefore in fact, by right of their crownes, did they both exerciſe, and commaund to be exerciſed, in their Kingly names, their Kingly right, authority and jurisdiction <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall</hi> within their Realmes. For how could thoſe Kings, haue commaunded, and how could their ſubjectes haue obeyed, if the Kings themſelues, had thought, and held, that the Eceleſiaſticall courts, lawes or jurisdiction, were not in right, no more then in fact, at that tyme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing unto the Crowne as the anſwerer, vaynly, and childiſhly fancyeth?

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſ, of ſundry the late deprived Miniſters. For non of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ever preached againſt the booke, nor depraved the ſame. They never refuſed to obſerue the ſame booke, according to the proeme of the booke &amp; tenor of the ſtatute. They were ſo farr from claymyng any immunitie, from being depraved, for their firſt offence, as that they ſtood and yet doe ſtand, upon their innocencyes, not to haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any offence at all, againſt the ſtatute puniſhable with deprivation, by the ſtatute they alleadge, that they were not puniſhable before the Kings Iuſtices by the ſtatute,

                     <p>Touching the ſtatut alleadged, 1. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it helpeth nowhitt at all the late deprivations of ſundry Miniſters, Firſt, becauſe ſuch Miniſters as haue been deprived onely for not conformyng themſelues, to the uſe of the booke provided by the pariſhioners cannot truly be charged to haue refuſed the booke commaunded by the ſtatute.

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:4866:57" rendition="simple:additions"/> preaching or in any other reſpect;</hi> is agaynſt charity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently agaynſt the word. For the weaknes of ſome mens body, at all tymes is ſuch, that they are not able to reade all and to preach. At ſometime alſo, the ſtrongeſt man, may haue ſuch an infirmity, that he may not be able to endure the performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of both. In winter, many times the extremity of cold, will not permit the whole audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to continue ſo long at Church. Then (will ſome ſay,) let preaching by ſuch perſons as are ſo weake, or at ſuch times, be omitted. This indeed is that which many would haue. But this is to performe bare reading before prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching: ignorance before knowledge: and the ordinances of man, before the commaundements of God.</p>
                     <p>The 18 <hi>Canon</hi> for bowing <hi>at the mention of the name of Ieſus,</hi> is abſurd in that reſpect: becauſe the place whereon it ſeemeth to be grounded,<note place="margin">philip. 2.10.</note> is not literally ſo to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. Firſt for that it ſpeaketh of things not only <hi>in earth</hi> but alſo <hi>in heaven, and under the earth,</hi> in which places ther are no <hi>knees.</hi> 2. It ſpeaketh not onely of men, but alſo of all other creatures. For it ſaith <hi>of all things.</hi> By the literall interpretation therefore, all creatures <hi>at the mention of the name of Ieſus,</hi> ſhould bend their <hi>knees.</hi> 3. By this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, no man muſt ſit whilſt any thing is read, that hath that name, or elſe the muſt riſe at the mention thereof to bowe their <hi>knee.</hi> 4. It is ſuperſtition, to giue more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to the name <hi>Ieſus</hi> then to the name <hi>Chriſt, God, Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> or the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 5. If the <hi>knee</hi> be ſo to be bowed, at the name of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> why not alſo at the name <hi>Saviour?</hi> For what doeth <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſignifie but <hi>Saviour?</hi> 6. The place ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not of that which is due to the name, but of that which is due to the perſon of Ieſus. So the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> are deceaved, with that fallacy, which is <hi>a rebus ad voces.</hi> 7. It
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:4866:57" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſpeaketh of that which is due to him, as well in private, as in publike places: in our houſes, at our tables, in our beds: as we ſit, as we walke, as we ly: If then we ſit at table, or ly in our beds etc: we muſt not ſpeake of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> but we muſt ariſe to make a legge. Laſtly, this name <hi>Ieſus,</hi> is no more then <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> who therfore is called <hi>Ieſus Act. 7.45.</hi> It is alſo the name of <hi>Iozadak. Zech. 3.1:</hi> compared with <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus 49.12:</hi> and <hi>Ezra 3.2:</hi> and of the Sonne of <hi>Syrach:</hi> and of one <hi>Iuſtus Coloſſ. 4.11.</hi> The common people therefore for want of preaching and by their owne negligence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ignorant, that they cannot well diſcerne the name <hi>Ieſus</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> from the ſame name of other, they may miſtake themſelues and bowe the knee, as well at the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other ſo named as of Ieſus our Lord and Saviour, and ſo ignorantly they ſhould commit blaſphemy. That which is ſaid for defence heerof by ſome, that we ſhould the rather bowe at this name, to teſtifie our hatred againſt <hi>Arrianiſme,</hi> is more dotage the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> divinity: and therfore not worthy any anſwer. The <hi>Deitie</hi> of Chriſt is more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by other names, eſpecially by the name <hi>Emmanuell,</hi> then by the name <hi>Ieſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Touching the <hi>Canons</hi> for <hi>Coapes, Surplices, Croſſe,</hi> and other Conformitie, as alſo touching the preſent <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> and manner of ordaynyng <hi>Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Preiſts, Deacons, etc:</hi> and for <hi>Subſcription;</hi> it is too long in this place, to ſet downe perticular reaſons againſt them. Therfore I referr the reader to perticular treatiſes of thoſe things, both her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and alſo lately written.</p>
                     <p>The 49. <hi>Canon,</hi> for no Miniſter to preach or expound any Scripture or matter of doctrine, without a ſpeciall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in that behalfe; is a moſt lamentable contrariety to the word, which commaundeth every Miniſter, both to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4866:58" rendition="simple:additions"/> be <hi>apt to teach,</hi> and <hi>to teach indeede.</hi> And I would gladly know of ſuch <hi>Canon</hi>-makers, whither thoſe that they call by the name of Miniſters, be Miniſters of the word or no? If they be Miniſters of the word, ſhall they not haue power to expound and preach the word by vertue of the ſaid Miniſtery? Yea, doe not they themſelues, when they ordayne them Miniſters, bid them <hi>take power to preach the word?</hi> It is yet more lamentable in the ſayde <hi>Canon,</hi> that they commaund all Miniſters (not ſpecially licenſed, to preach or expound in their owne chardges) onely <hi>to ſtudy to read plainely and aptly (without glozing or adding) the Homi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lies already ſet forth, or heerafter to be publiſhed etc.</hi> For doe not theſe words plainely import, that ſome Miniſters are not able to read without ſtudiyng for it, even after they be made Miniſters? Yea, doe not the words <hi>(onely to ſtudy to read plainely and aptly the Homilies etc.)</hi> implye a precept againſt ſtudiyng to read the ſcriptures, which are harder then Homileis: eſpecially againſt ſtudiyng to preach heer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>after? O miſerable condition then of ſuch people, as haue ſuch Miniſters as muſt goe to ſchoole to learne to read the Homilies, not the ſcriptures, yea and which muſt not ſtudy at all ever to Preach.</p>
                     <p>The 53. <hi>Canon</hi> againſt confuting of any publike doctrine (how hereticall or dangerous ſo ever) before the <hi>Bishop</hi> be made acquainted with the ſaid doctrine; is moſt preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to the ſalvation of the hearers of ſuch erroneous teaching. For the ſoules of men beyng by nature as capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any errors, as their bodyes are of any infectious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe; and the Biſhop of the ſame Dioceſſe, ſometime per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps dwelling or beynge an hundred myles from the Church, wherein ſuch errors were delivered; and the life of man being moſt uncertaine; and Biſhops themſelues
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:4866:58" rendition="simple:additions"/> being ſometime erroneous, and therefore not very haſtie to haue errors confuted: may not many a ſoule be infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſuch error, yea, and dye in them, before any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy can be had againſt them?</p>
                     <p>This ſhall ſuffice for a taſt of the contrariety of divers <hi>Canons,</hi> to Gods word. If I ſhould perticularly runne over other, that haue like co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariety; this volume would much exceed, both my owne purpoſe, and alſo the likyng of all readers.</p>
                     <p>Before I proceed to the <hi>Canons</hi> repugnant to the lawes of the land; let me here interlace one reaſon in a word ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to proue, both the <hi>Canons</hi> and alſo the booke of <hi>Common prayer</hi> (now impoſed upon Miniſters,) not yet to be eſtabliſhed by law, and ſo conſequently all the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Prelats againſt the ſaid Miniſters for not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribyng, obſerving the booke, conformity etc, to be with out law, and a gainſt law. This one reaſon, is from the late Bill of the <hi>Bishops</hi> preſented to the <hi>Parliament</hi> for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing both of the booke of <hi>Common prayer,</hi> and alſo of their <hi>Canons.</hi> For if the ſaid booke and <hi>Canons</hi> were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy good in law; what needed any new ſtatute to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh them? If they ſay <hi>that abundans cautela non nocet, plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull caution is not hurtfull,</hi> they muſt alſo remember, that they haue likewiſe learned, <hi>fruſtra fit per plura, quod fieri poteſt per pauciora: It is in vayne to doe that by many thinges, which may be done by fewe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to the <hi>Canons</hi> repugnant to the law.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We decree and appoynt</hi> (ſaith the Synod) <hi>that no iudge, ad quem, shall admitt or allow any his or their appeales</hi> (ſpeaking as they call them of obſtinate and factious appellants) <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he haue firſt ſeene the originall appeale. But the King (ſay I) is a iudge ad quem. Ergo, the King</hi> (ſaith this Synod) <hi>may
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4866:59" rendition="simple:additions"/> not admitt or allow any appeale etc.</hi> The liberty, and franchiſe then of the Kings will, and grace, after this unwonted manner, (by a <hi>Synodall</hi> decree onely) beyng thus blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, impeched, and reſtrayned; what dignity, prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, ſuperiority, or prerogatiue, hath the Kings grace, when the King himſelfe is chardged, not to grant any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition out of his Court of <hi>Chauncery,</hi> but conditionally and upon <hi>an unleſſe etc.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if by this <hi>Canon,</hi> the Kings will and grace, receiue let, hinderance, and prejudice; what ſhould we thinke, but that this <hi>Canon</hi> alſo tendeth, to the weakenyng of the Kings arme and power? For how can his power be ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, and his arme able to help, when his grace is bound, and his will, unable to will?</p>
                     <p>And then agayne, if theſe two mayne pillars of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties prerogatiue Royall (namely his grace and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer) be thus ſhaken by this <hi>Canon,</hi> muſt it not neceſſarily follow, that the Lords and Commons in Parliament, are prejudiced therby? For the rights &amp; prerogatiues, of the Kings Crowne, by the lawes of the Realme, be not inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and appropried, unto the Kings perſon, onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his Majeſties owne Royall eſtate; but alſo for the good condition, and preſervation of his body Politicke, which is the Common wealth. Which body alſo for the juſt, and neceſſary defence both of the head (which is the King) and of it ſelfe, hath ſuch a proper clayme, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, in, and to the grace, and power of the head, as the leſt jote of the power and grace of the head, may not be ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed to the prejudice of the body, without conſent of the body. viz: of the Lords &amp; Commons in Parliament, who are the very image, and true repreſentiue body of the Realme: yea and thus much in effect, haue the Kings
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:4866:59" rendition="simple:additions"/> progenitors, and the Aunceſtors of our Nobles, and Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons agreed upon in Parliament; when by their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and conſent, it was forbidden, that any thing ſhould be attempted, which ſhould tend, to the blemiſhyng of the Kings prerogatiue, or to the prejudice of his Lords &amp; Commons. And when alſo, by common conſent,<note place="margin">Acts &amp; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents 4: Ed. 3 pag 422. 424:</note> it was enacted in effect, that neither King <hi>Iohn,</hi> nor any other King, could bring his Realme and people in thraledome, and ſubjection, but by conſent in Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore appeales beyng <hi>de iure naturali,</hi> and intro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duced into judgement ſeats, <hi>tam ob defenſionem et preſidiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> innocentiae, quam ad deprimendam iniquitatem, et corrigendam imperitiam iudicis;</hi> as well for the defence and ſavegard of innocency, as for the depresſing of the iniquity, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the unskilfulnes of a Iudge, as they haue been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore allowed by the lawes, &amp; cuſto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es of the Realme, ſo haue they been ſuffered, as freely to be proſecuted, as interpoſed. For otherwiſe, how ſhould either innocency be protected, or the injuſtice of a judge reformed, in caſe an appeale being interpoſed, might not be proſecuted, <hi>fruſtra</hi> (ſaith S. Edward Cooke) <hi>expectatur eventus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">de jure Reg Eccleſ.</note> 
                        <hi>cuius ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus nullus ſequitur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And according unto this naturall equity, hath it been ſpecially provided by a Statute of the realme, that the Kings ſubjects, being greived, ſhould not only haue liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to make, but alſo, to take, haue, uſe, and proſecute all manner of appeales, after ſuch manner, forme, and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is limited, for appeales, to be had, and proſecuted. And for lacke of Iuſtice many Courts of the <hi>Archbishops</hi> of this Realme, it is lawfull for the partie greived, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to the Kinges Majeſtie in his Court of <hi>Chauncery.</hi> And upon every ſuch appeale, a Commisſion (ſaith the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:4866:60" rendition="simple:additions"/> Statute) ſhalbe directed under the great Seale, to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſons, as ſhalbe named by the Kings Highnes, to heare and definitivly determine ſuch appeales, with the cauſes, and all circumſtances. It is therefore apparant, that this <hi>Canon,</hi> is contrary or repugnant to this Statute. For this <hi>Canon,</hi> and this ſtatute thus repugnantly providing, and working divers repugnant effects, the ſtatute ſimply, admitting the uſe and proſecution of all manner of appeales, the <hi>Canon</hi> not admittyng but conditionally the uſe and proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome appeales; can not ſtand together.</p>
                     <p>Agayne, ſome inferiour Ordinaryes having libertie, to take the bridle in their owne teeth, &amp; to lay the reynes looſe, on their owne neckes, may in tyme (beyng proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pampred) wax wanton in their judgement ſeates; when they ſhall ſtand in no awe, of having, the nullitie or injqui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty of their proceſſ and ſentences, weyed in the ballance of any ſuperiour Iudge. By reaſon whereof, this <hi>Canon,</hi> can not but proue exceeding onerovs to the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>For let a man or woman, dwelling at <hi>Michaels Mount,</hi> be but once judicially, (though perhaps wrongfully) cited by the name of a factious or obſtinat perſon, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temner of ceremonyes, and from ſuch wrongfull citations, let his, or her appeale, made to the Kings Majeſtie in his Court of <hi>Chauncery</hi> (if it be fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Archbishop,</hi>) or unto the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop</hi> (if it be from the <hi>Dioceſan</hi>) be never ſo juſt, &amp; equal, thereis no remedy in this caſe, before his, or hirs appeale, be admitted or allowed, but the ſame man or woman (by the letter of this <hi>Canon</hi>) muſt perſonally appeare, in the <hi>Archbishops Conſiſtory,</hi> if the appeale be by the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> and if the appeale be to the King in the Kings Court of <hi>Chauncery,</hi> though the ſame ſhould be at <hi>Barwicke.</hi> Yea, and though the party appellant be never ſo poore, aged,

Nay not only perſonall appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but perſonall ſubſcription alſo, by this <hi>Canon</hi> is requyred, to the Kings Supremacie, to the Articles of Religion, to the booke of Homilies, to the booke of Common prayer, and to the booke of Conſecrating <hi>Biſhops,</hi> be the party ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellant, never ſo ſimple a laborer, or never ſo ſilly a ſpi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſter.</p>
                     <p>The 37. <hi>Canon</hi> diſauthoriſeth every Miniſter by what authority ſo ever he be admitted, to preach, or to read a Lecture in any place within the Realme, unleſſe he be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenced, either by the <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> or by the <hi>Bishop</hi> of the <hi>Dioceſſ,</hi> or by one of the two Univerſities under their hands and ſeale. Let the King then under his broad ſeale, graunt licence to any of his Chapleines to preach within his owne chapple, this licenc by this <hi>Canon,</hi> is of no value; then the which what can be more derogatory, to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne dignity of the King in cauſes <hi>Eccleſiaſticall?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Unto the mould of this <hi>Canon,</hi> agreeth the 47. <hi>Canon,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ed) which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth, that no Miniſter not lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed a Preacher, under the hand &amp; ſeale of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of the <hi>Dioceſſ,</hi> or <hi>Archbishop</hi> of the <hi>Province,</hi> or under the ſeale of one of the Vniverſities, ſhall take upon him to expound, in his owne cure any ſcripture, or matter of doctrine, but ſhall onely ſtudy <hi>to read playnely, and aptly, without gloſing or addyng, the Homilies already ſet forth, or heerafter to be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by lawfull authority.</hi> The King then by this Canon, may not licence, a Miniſter to preach or to expound any ſcripture, no not in his own cure, no though the miniſters Cure, be the Kings owne houſhold, or the houſhould of the Prince, or any other of the Kings children. Nay by theſe two <hi>Canons</hi> and the <hi>Canon</hi> of ſubſcription it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the <hi>Prelats</hi> intended, that every <hi>Scotish</hi> Miniſter havyng renounced the <hi>Hierachie,</hi> and embraced the ſingle
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:4866:61" rendition="simple:additions"/> forme of Goverment in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhould be barred from preaching at any time before the King in England, unleſſ he ſhould ſubſcribe to the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> For with out a licence may none preach, and without ſubſcription may none be licenced.</p>
                     <p>And not onely is this 47. <hi>Canon,</hi> derogatorie to the Kings prerogatiue, but it is alſo repugnant, to other the Kings lawes and ſtatuts. For whereby that ſtatute, made againſt <hi>Lolardy,</hi> and <hi>Hereſie,,</hi> it was enacted, that none ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to Preach openly, or privily, without the licence of the Dioceſan, firſt requyred &amp; obtayned, yet by the ſame Act, Curats in their owne Churches, and Parſons privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged were excepted, and by the Provinciall Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, confirmed and ratified by Parliament, it is provided thus: <hi>We eſtablish, that no ſecular, or regular, not authoriſed by written law, or protected by ſpeciall priviledg, to preach the word of God, may take upon him the preaching or exerciſe of the ſame word, within any Church, or without any Church, unleſſ firſt he preſent and ſubmit himſelfe, to the examination of the Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan etc: But concernyng aperpetuall</hi> Curate, <hi>we underſtand ſuch a one, by law and right to be ſent to the place, and people of his Cure.</hi> And that we may underſtand whom the Canon meaneth, to be a perpetuall Curate the gloſſ ſheweth us, <hi>that a Bishop in his Dioceſſ, a Parſon and Vicar in his Parish, and every other Perſon intituled, to any benefice whereunto apper teyneth cure of ſoules,</hi> is to be underſtood to be a perpetuall Curate, and that he may preach in his owne Cure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Biſhops licence.</p>
                     <p>Moreover by the booke of ordering Biſhops, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and Deacons, every one made a Miniſter, promiſeth <hi>that he will giue all faithfull diligence alwayes, to miniſter the doctrine etc: as the Lord hath commanded etc: ſo that he will
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:4866:61" rendition="simple:additions"/> teach the people committed to his cure and chardg, withall dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to keepe and obſerue the ſame.</hi> But how can a Miniſter inſtruct and teach the people committed to his chardge, according to his publicke vowe, if (as it is ſayd in this <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>) he ſhall not take upon him to expound in his owne Cure, any ſcripture or matter of doctrine at all, but ſhall onely ſtudy to read plainely and aptly, (without gloſing or adding) the Homilies etc?</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, the wordes of the Biſhops inſtitution are theſe. <hi>Teque rectorem eiuſdem, ac de, et ineadem inſtituimus canonice, et inveſtimus, cum ſuis iuribus, et pertinentiis univerſis, curam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que et regimen animarum prochianorum ibidem in Domino co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittimus per-preſentes.</hi> And we (ſpeaking of a Clarke to be inſtituted into a benefice) Canonically inſtitute thee rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the ſame Church, and of,<note place="margin">Cure &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment by law ought to go together in a miniſter</note> and in the ſame doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt thee, withall her rights &amp; appertinances; and by theſe preſents, we in the Lord commit unto thee both the cure and goverment, of the ſoules of the Pariſhioners in that place. The Clearke then inſtituted into a benefice, by theſe wordes of the Biſhops inſtitution, by the booke of ordering of Biſhops, Miniſters, and Deacons, and by the Provinciall Conſtitutions, having not a private, but a pub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>licke office, of cure and regiment of ſoules, committed unto him; how can it ſeeme reaſonable, that he ſhould be countermanded by reaſon of a Provinciall decree not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Act of Parliament, not to excerciſe the ſame his publicke office, without a Biſhops licence? For what if the Biſhops refuſe to grant him a licence? Or what if the Biſhops and his officers ſee, for graunting, writing, &amp; ſealyng his licence be greater then the poore Miniſter is able to disburſt, is it reaſon that his chardg by this mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es ſhould be left uninſtructed? Nay is it not, as if a <hi>Sergiant</hi>

You may perhaps haue ſome reward in the end of ſuch paynes: (ſuch as men can beſtowe upon you) but looke more to that reward, that is in the right hand of the great maſter of all rewards.
